## Project Description:
This Java program creates vehicles with different engine types (combustion, electric, and hybrid) and saves them into files based on various filters (make, model, year, and price). The solution demonstrates object-oriented programming principles using inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract methods.

## Features:
- Class hierarchy for `Engine` and `Vehicle` types.
- Array of vehicles, containing ICEV, BEV, and HybridV objects.
- Demonstration of vehicle characteristics using the `ShowCharacteristics()` method.

## Development Environment:
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1 (or specify the one you are using)
- **Language**: Java 17
- **JDK**: OpenJDK 17
- **Build Tool**: None (standard Java compilation)

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository using:
